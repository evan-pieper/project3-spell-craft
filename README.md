# project3-spell-craft


## Description

The plan for this app is to ultimately allow users to create their own trading-card-game style card game. Users will be able to create their own cards, and then create their own decks of cards. They will then be able to play against other users, and the app will handle the game logic.

At present the only functionality is the ability to signup, login, and logout. The app is built using React, Express, and MongoDB.


## Usage

To use this app, simply visit the deployed site at https://spell-craft.herokuapp.com/. You can create an account, and then login.
